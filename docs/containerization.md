# Containerizaton

The model training code is containerized using the S2I.

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible container images from source code. S2I produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a container image and letting the container prepare that source code for execution. By creating self-assembling builder images, you can version and control your build environments exactly like you use container images to version your runtime environments.

Containerizing the source code allowed the model to be run 

1. Fewer resources
2. Environment isolation
3. Quick deployment
4. Quick startup/shutdown
5. Encapsulation and portability
6. Reusability
7. Reproducible
